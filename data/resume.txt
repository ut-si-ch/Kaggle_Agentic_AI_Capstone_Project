PROJECTS
Shopper Spectrum – Customer Segmentation & Product Recommendation
•
Designed a hybrid system combining customer segmentation (RFM analysis + clustering) and product recommendation using collaborative filtering.
•
Performed EDA, built pivot tables, and applied cosine similarity for personalized product recommendations.
•
Applied K-Means and hierarchical clustering (Ward linkage) on RFM features to identify high-value customer groups.
•
Achieved 0.616 Silhouette Score on K-Means, deployed an interactive Streamlit app allowing users to explore customer segments and get real-time product suggestions.
Brain Tumor MRI Image Classification
•
Built deep learning models to classify MRI brain scans into glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and no tumor categories.
•
Performed EDA, sanity checks, and preprocessing on 2,443 MRI images labeled by medical experts.
•
Developed a custom CNN and compared performance with transfer learning models (MobileNetV2, ResNet50, EfficientNetB0).
•
Fine-tuned top-performing model (CNN) to achieve 84% test accuracy with improved medical relevance.
•
Deployed the champion model to a Streamlit web app for real-time predictions from uploaded MRI scans.
Flipkart Customer Service Satisfaction Classification
•
Implemented ML models to predict customer satisfaction scores (CSAT) from support channel, issue type, and agent performance data.
•
Performed EDA, hypothesis testing (ANOVA, t-tests), and feature engineering (e.g., call connectivity, order date flags).
•
Compared Logistic Regression and Random Forest, tuned hyperparameters, achieved 82% accuracy with 90% recall on Logistic Regression, and selected the best model based on business-relevant metrics.
•
